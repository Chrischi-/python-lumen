Some very simple python code to control a Tabu Lumen RGB strip.
It uses bluez gatttool so it only works on Linux (as far as I know).
It works on x86, Raspberry Pi, and NTC CHIP all unning a Debian Jessie based OS.

You must first initiate a manual connection with hcitool:
sudo hcitool lescan
sudo hcitool lecc <MAC>

lumen.py is a command line tool
You can supply interface and address on the command line

lumen-mqtt.py uses the python paho client to subscribe to a topic and processes the messages
You can supply interface and address on the command line
Replace TOPIC, BROKER, and PORT in the source
It is based off the example paho mqtt client subscriber code

lumen-rest.py exposes a REST service using Flask
lumen-rest-zeroconf.py adds a zeroconf service advertisement
Replace interface and address in source


Todo;
- update source to use bluepy to avoid the manual connection and remove the need to supply the MAC address
