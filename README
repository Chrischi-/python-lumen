Some very simple python code to control a Tabu Lumen RGB strip.
It uses bluez gatttool so it only works on Linux (as far as I know).
It works on x86, Raspberry Pi, and NTC CHIP running a Debian Jessie based OS.

lumen.py is a command line tool
lumen-rest.py exposes it as a REST service using Flask
lumen-rest-zeroconf.py adds a zeroconf service advertisement
